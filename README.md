## Pull docker image from Docker Hub:

```python
docker pull antonfolkmann/flowmethod
```

Run docker image:

```python
docker run -it antonfolkmann/flowmethod bash
```

Inside the docker container go to the scripts folder and execute the scripts in the following sequence:

- `clone_repos.sh`
    - Here, it is important to give your git username and a Git Authentication Token, as passwords donâ€™t work for GitHub CLI
- `run_codeql.sh`
- `generate_flowtree.sh`

The flowtree has now been created, and is ready for `mapequation.org/infomap`
